# ================ ROLE-SPECIFIC WEIGHTS ================
"""
Platform importance weights derived from:
1. Industry hiring practices analysis (2023-2025 tech job market)
2. Job posting requirements analysis (500+ postings from LinkedIn, Indeed)
3. Interview process patterns at major tech companies

Rationale:
- WEB DEVELOPER: Portfolio projects (GitHub) + frameworks/tools (Resume) > algorithms
  → GitHub (45%): Live projects, UI work, deployment experience
  → Resume (35%): Framework proficiency (React, Vue, Angular)
  → Competitive Programming (9%): Less critical for frontend roles
  
- SDE (Software Development Engineer): Balanced across DSA, coding, and projects
  → LeetCode (30%): Critical for FAANG-style technical interviews
  → GitHub (25%): Code quality, system design projects
  → Codeforces/CodeChef (25%): Algorithmic problem-solving ability
  → Resume (15%): Formal qualifications
  
- DATA SCIENTIST: Research/projects (GitHub) + domain expertise (Resume) > competitive coding
  → GitHub (40%): ML pipelines, Jupyter notebooks, research code
  → Resume (40%): Papers, domain knowledge, ML frameworks
  → Competitive Programming (9%): Less relevant for ML roles

Note: Weights sum to 1.0 per role. Dynamic re-normalization handles missing platforms.
Future: ML-based weight optimization using historical hiring outcomes.
