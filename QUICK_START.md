## 🎓 Key Concepts (1 minute)

### How It Works (3 phases):

```
1. DATA COLLECTION
   You connect platforms (GitHub, LeetCode, etc.)
   ↓
2. AI ANALYSIS  
   System converts your profile to AI "embeddings"
   ↓
3. MATCHING
   Compares with job description using vector similarity
   Result: Compatibility score (0-100%)
```

### What Each Score Means:

```
90-100% → Perfect match! Apply now! 🟢
75-90%  → Great fit, strong candidate 🟢
60-75%  → Good match, worth applying 🟡
45-60%  → Some skills match, need improvement 🟠
0-45%   → Not a good fit right now 🔴
```

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: How long does analysis take?**  
A: First time: 15-30 seconds | After that: 5-15 seconds

**Q: Can I use it without all 5 platforms?**  
A: Yes! But more platforms = more accurate. Minimum 1 platform.

**Q: Is my data safe?**  
A: Yes! Passwords encrypted, data stored locally, no sharing with third parties.

**Q: Can I use this on cloud/remote server?**  
A: Yes, but for beginners, local machine is easier. See full manual for cloud setup.
